About 0.0.4

Sorry for my English, i'm french. Also, i never used GitHub before.

I made 2 modifications for this 0.0.4.

- Bug fix : when one or more protect plugins handled by QuickSignReloaded (WorldGuard, Residence, Regios, LWC or ChestShop) are load on the server but NOT all of them, the selection was forbidden unless player has the quicksign.freeuse permission.

- Also, I add a rules for allow the sign selection : it must don't contain a line with a '[]' expression ! This allow to protect a lot of sign created by some plugins that QuickSign don't handled.
A permission was created to bypass this protection : quicksign.selbracketssign.

It was Compiled against Bukkit 1.5.2 like 0.0.3 version, but it works perfectly in 1.6.2 !

Gemil01, I let you, if you want, update QuickSignReloaded at http://dev.bukkit.org.

I only update/change 4 files :
-handler/SelectionHandler.java
-permission/permission.java
-util/BlackList.java
-This ReadMe.
